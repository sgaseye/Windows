To open CMD, you can either use the Windows Run tool by pressing WIN + R and then typing in CMD—or you can search for “CMD” in the Windows toolbar.

Then you can navigate to the folder of your choice by using the basic dir command.

That said, CMD also hides hidden files and folders by default. Because of that, it’s not enough to type in dir C:your-folder as this will only show visible files.

To show hidden files, you need to include the /a:h modifier in that command. So, 

dir /a:h C:your-folder 




changing permission in cmd in windows


I try the below way and it work for me:
1. open cmd.exe
2. takeown /R /F *.*
3. icacls * /T /grant [username]:(D)
4. del *.* /S /Q

So that the files can become my own access and it assign to "Delete" and then I can delete the files and folders.






As of Vista, cacls is deprecated. Here's the first couple of help lines:

C:\>cacls
NOTE: Cacls is now deprecated, please use Icacls.

Displays or modifies access control lists (ACLs) of files

You should use icacls instead. This is how you grant John full control over D:\test folder and all its subfolders:

C:\>icacls "D:\test" /grant John:(OI)(CI)F /T

According do MS documentation:

    F = Full Control
    CI = Container Inherit - This flag indicates that subordinate containers will inherit this ACE.
    OI = Object Inherit - This flag indicates that subordinate files will inherit the ACE.
    /T = Apply recursively to existing files and sub-folders. (OI and CI only apply to new files and sub-folders). Credit: comment by @AlexSpence.

For complete documentation, you may run "icacls" with no arguments or see the Microsoft documentation here and here

Use cacls command. See information here.

    CACLS files /e /p {USERNAME}:{PERMISSION}

    Where,

    /p : Set new permission

    /e : Edit permission and kept old permission as it is i.e. edit ACL instead of replacing it.

    {USERNAME} : Name of user

    {PERMISSION} : Permission can be:

    R - Read

    W - Write

    C - Change (write)

    F - Full control

    For example grant Rocky Full (F) control with following command (type at Windows command prompt):

    C:> CACLS files /e /p rocky:f

    Read complete help by typing following command:

    C:> cacls /?






Open a Command Prompt, then execute this command:

    icacls "c:\somelocation\of\path" /q /c /t /grant Users:F

F gives Full Access.

/q /c /t applies the permissions to subfolders.

Note: Sometimes "Run as Administrator" will help.







You can also use ICACLS.

To grant the Users group Full Control to a folder:

>icacls "C:\MyFolder" /grant Users:F

To grant Modify permission to IIS users for C:\MyFolder (if you need your IIS has ability to R/W files into specific folder):

>icacls "C:\MyFolder" /grant IIS_IUSRS:M

If you do ICACLS /? you will be able to see all available options.
